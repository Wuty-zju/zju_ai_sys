ABSTRACT

Underwater images play a key role in ocean exploration but often suffer from severe quality degradation due to light absorption and scattering in the water medium. Although major breakthroughs have been made recently in the general area of image enhancement and restoration, the applicability of new methods for improving the quality of underwater images has not specifically been captured. In this paper, we review the image enhancement and restoration methods that tackle typical underwater image impairments, including some extreme degradations and distortions. Firstly, we introduce the key causes of quality reduction in underwater images, in terms of the underwater image formation model (IFM). Then, we review underwater restoration methods, considering both the IFM-free and the IFM-based approaches. Next, we present an experimental-based comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art IFM-free and IFM-based methods, considering also the prior-based parameter estimation algorithms of the IFM-based methods, using both subjective and objective analysis (the used code is freely available at GitHub Repository). Starting from this study, we pinpoint the key shortcomings of existing methods, drawing recommendations for future research in this area. Our review of underwater image enhancement and restoration provides researchers with the necessary background to appreciate challenges and opportunities in this important field.

I. INTRODUCTION

The oceans contain unknown creatures and vast energy resources, playing an important role in the continuation of life on Earth [1]. Hence, significant effort has been dedicated worldwide, since the middle of the 20th century, to actively engage in high-tech marine exploration activities. Vision technology has attracted significant attention for its ability to carry high information density [2]. Researchers strive to capture high-quality underwater images for a variety of underwater applications, including robotics [3], rescue missions, man-made structures inspection, ecological monitoring, and real-time navigation [4], [5].

However, the quality of underwater images is severely affected by the particular physical and chemical characteristics of underwater conditions, raising issues that are more easily overcome in terrestrial imaging.

Underwater images always show color cast, e.g., green-bluish color, which is caused by different attenuation ratios of red, green, and blue lights. Also, the particles that are suspended underwater absorb the majority of light energy and change the direction of light before the light reflected from the underwater scene reaches the camera, which leads to images having low contrast, blur, and haze [6].

In order to increase the range of underwater imaging, artificial light sources are often used. Yet, artificial light too is affected by absorption and scattering [7]. At the same time, non-uniform illumination is introduced, resulting in bright spots at the center of the underwater image, with insufficient illumination towards the borders. Other quality degradation phenomena include, for instance, shadowing. Thus, extracting valuable information for underwater scenes requires effective methods to correct color, improve clarity, and address blurring and background scattering, which is the aim of image enhancement and restoration algorithms. These are particularly challenging due to the complex underwater environment, where images are degraded by the influence of water turbidity, light absorption, and scattering, which may vary broadly.

Understanding the underwater optical imaging model could help us better design and propose robust and effective enhancement strategies. Figure 1 shows the underwater optical imaging process and the selective attenuation of light, which is drawn and modified based on the model proposed by Huang et al. [8]. The selective attenuation characteristic is shown on the right side of Figure 1. When traveling through water, the red light—having a longer wavelength—is absorbed faster than green and blue wavelengths (which are shorter). That is why underwater images often appear to have green-bluish tones.

Figure 1 shows the interaction between light, transmission medium, camera, and scene. The camera receives three types of light energy in line of sight (LOS): the direct transmission light energy reflected from the scene captured (direct transmission); the light from the scene that is scattered by small particles but still reaches the camera (forward scattering); and the light coming from atmospheric light and reflected by the suspended particles (background scattering) [9]. In the real-world underwater scene, the use of artificial light sources tends to aggravate the adverse effect of background scattering. The particles suspended underwater generate unwanted noise and aggravate the visibility of dimming images. The imaging process of underwater images can also be represented as the linear superposition of the above three components [10], [11], and is shown as follows:

￼

Where ￼ represents the coordinates of individual image pixels; ￼, ￼, ￼, and ￼ represent the total signal energy captured by the camera, the direct transmission component, the forward scattering component, and the background scattering component, respectively. Since the distance between the underwater scene and the camera is relatively close, the forward scattering component can be ignored, and only the direct transmission and background scattering components [12]–[16] are considered.

If we define ￼ as the underwater scene, ￼ as the residual energy ratio after ￼ was captured by the camera, and ￼ as the homogenous background light, then the scene captured by the camera ￼ can be represented as in Equation (2), which is considered as the simplified underwater image imaging model (IFM).

￼

Where ￼ represents one particular point ￼ of the scene image, ￼ is one of the red, green, and blue (RGB) channels, and ￼ and ￼ represent the direct transmission and background scattering components, respectively.

The visibility of underwater images can be improved using hardware [17]–[22] and software solutions [15], [23]–[26].

FIGURE 1. Diagram of underwater optical imaging.

The specialized hardware platforms and cameras can be expensive and power-consuming. What is more, they are not adaptive to different underwater environments. Thus, many algorithmic methods have been developed for underwater image quality improvement by image enhancement or restoration.

Although some reviews of underwater image enhancement and restoration have been published, these tend to only concentrate on certain aspects of underwater processing. For example, Kaeli et al. [27] focused on algorithms for underwater image color correction; Sahu et al. [28] introduced limited underwater image enhancement methods. Lu et al. [29] and Han et al. [30] reviewed more aspects of underwater optical processing, including underwater image de-scattering, underwater image restoration, underwater image quality assessments, and future trends and challenges in designing and processing underwater images.

Nonetheless, several issues are not fully addressed in previous reviews: 1) the existing classifications are incomplete and miss the latest developments based, for instance, on deep learning; 2) it remains unclear the extent to which specific methods improve image quality and how.

In this paper, we address the above problems, providing a broader review, an experimental-based comparison of key methods, and an up-to-date snapshot of challenges and future directions.

It should be noted that we focus specifically on quality improvement algorithms for single underwater images. Our contributions to the study of quality improvement of underwater images are multi-fold:

	1.	Categorization of Quality Improvement Methods: We categorize the quality improvement methods of underwater images into two broad classes: IFM-free image enhancement methods and IFM-based image restoration methods, from the perspective that these methods improve image quality either through the optical imaging physical model or not. The categories of the reviewed methods are shown in Figure 2, which will help better understand which models are suited best for which problem domain.
	2.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a review of IFM-free image enhancement methods, followed by an overview of IFM-based image restoration methods in Section III. The experimental-based comparisons of different methods for underwater image improvement are presented in Section IV. Finally, the discussion and future work directions are stated in Section V.

接下来将进入 Section II 的详细内容。

以下是 Section II：IFM-Free Image Enhancement 部分的内容：

II. IFM-FREE IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

IFM-free underwater image enhancement methods improve the contrast and color of images mainly based on pixel intensity re-distribution, without considering the particular underwater imaging principles. Early studies of underwater image enhancement often apply outdoor image enhancement methods directly to underwater images. Later methods are specially designed according to the characteristics of underwater images, such as hazing, color cast, and low contrast. These methods change the pixel values in either the spatial domain or a transformed domain. Recently, deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been used for image enhancement, based on the idea that hidden features may be learned for quality enhancement.

In this review, we separate the IFM-free methods into three subclasses: spatial-domain image enhancement [31]–[37]; transform-domain image enhancement [38]–[42]; and CNN-based image enhancement [43]–[45].

A. SPATIAL-DOMAIN IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

The histograms of underwater images show a relatively more concentrated distribution of pixel values than in natural images. Therefore, expanding the dynamic range of the image histogram provides a way for enhancing the visibility of underwater images. Spatial-domain image enhancement methods complete an intensity histogram redistribution by expanding gray levels based on the gray mapping theory [46]. This can be done in different color models. Common color models include Red-Green-Blue (RGB), Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI), Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), and CIE-Lab. Based on whether a single color model (SCM) or multiple color model (MCM) is used in the histogram redistribution process, we can divide spatial-domain image enhancement methods into SCM-based and MCM-based image enhancement.

1) SCM-based Image Enhancement

Many methods work in the RGB color model. Histogram Equalization (HE) [47], Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) [48], Gamma Correction, and Generalized Unsharp Masking (GUM) [49] are regarded as typical contrast enhancement methods to improve the global visibility of low-light images. Gray-World Assumption (GWA), White Balancing (WB), and Gray-Edge Assumption (GEA) are seen as traditional color correction methods to modify the color and saturation of the images. Due to the low energy of RGB components in underwater images (lacking illumination in underwater environments), it is common to introduce serious artifacts and halos, amplify the internal noise of the image, and even cause color distortion when HE, GWA, WB, and their variations are directly used for underwater image enhancement. Since the contrast of underwater images is low and the edge features are hazed, GEA often fails to enhance underwater images.

Fusion is an effective strategy for underwater image enhancement in a single color model. In 2012, Ancuti et al. [50] proposed a fusion-based method. Firstly, two fusion images are generated from the input image: the first image is color corrected by white balance, and the second image is contrast-enhanced by local adaptive histogram equalization. Then, four fusion weights are determined according to the contrast, salient features, and exposure of the two fused images. Finally, the two fused images and the defined weights are combined to produce the enhanced images with better global contrast and detail information by using the multi-scale fusion strategy.

In 2017, Liu et al. [51] proposed a method called Deep Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (DSNMF) to estimate the illumination of underwater images. The observed images were segmented into small blocks, each channel of the local block was reconstructed into an ￼ matrix, and the depth of each input matrix was decomposed into multiple layers by the sparsity constraint of the DSNMF method. The last layer of the factorization matrix is used as the illumination for the patch, and the image is adjusted with sparse constraints. After factorization, the local block illumination of the original image is estimated to obtain the enhanced image.

2) MCM-based Image Enhancement

In 2005, Torres-Méndez et al. [52] used Markov Random Field (MRF) to describe the correlation between underwater images before and after distortion and enhanced the color of images based on the maximum a posteriori. When calculating the dissimilarity of image patches, the image is transformed to the CIE-Lab color space to represent equal perceived differences. The experimental data obtained from different underwater scenes verified the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

In 2010, Iqbal et al. [53] proposed an underwater image enhancement algorithm based on an Integrated Colour Model (ICM). Firstly, the heavily attenuated GB channels in the RGB color model are stretched through the entire range ￼. Then, the image is converted to the HSI color model, and the ￼ and ￼ components are finally stretched with sliding histogram stretching to improve the saturation and brightness of the output image.

In 2017, Ghani et al. [37] proposed Recursive Adaptive Histogram Modification (RAHIM), which increases the natural performance of image color by modifying the saturation and brightness of the image in the HSV color model through Rayleigh distribution and the human visual system. Finally, the enhanced image is converted to the RGB color model.

B. TRANSFORM-DOMAIN IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

In the frequency domain, the high-frequency image component usually corresponds to the edge region where the pixel values change significantly; whereas, the low-frequency component represents the flat background region in the image [58]. Transform-domain image enhancement methods commonly transform the spatial domain image into the frequency domain (e.g., through the Fourier Transform) [59], and improve the quality of underwater images by amplifying the high-frequency component and suppressing the low-frequency component simultaneously [60]. Hazed underwater images often exhibit a small difference between the high-frequency component of the edge region and the low-frequency component of the background region [61]. Therefore, underwater image quality can also be improved by using transform-domain methods [62], such as homomorphic filter [63], high-boost filter, and wavelet-transform.

In 2010, Prabhakar et al. [64] used a homomorphic filter and an anisotropic filter to correct non-uniform illumination and smooth the image. Finally, they applied adaptive wavelet sub-band thresholding with a modified BayesShrink function to implement de-noising.

Recently, underwater image enhancement methods based on Wavelet transformation have become more common. In 2016, Amjad et al. [38] proposed a wavelet-based fusion method to enhance hazy underwater images by addressing the low contrast and color alteration issues. Firstly, two fusion images are generated from the original image, by stretching the value component of the original image over the whole range in the HSV color model and enhanced by CLAHE. Then, the wavelet-based fusion method consists of a sequence of low-pass and high-pass filters to eliminate unwanted low and high frequencies presented in the image and acquire details of approximation coefficients separately to facilitate the fusion process.

In 2017, Vasamsetti et al. [40] proposed a framework of wavelet-based perspective enhancement technique for underwater images. By applying the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on the RGB channels to generate two decomposition levels, they collect the approximation and detailed responses for these parts to reconstruct the grayscale images for R-G-B channels. This method also serves as pre-processing for underwater detection and tracking techniques, boosting the accuracy of high-level underwater computer vision tasks.

Although transform-domain underwater image enhancement methods can improve the visibility and contrast of hazy images, they tend to over-amplify noise and cause color distortion.

C. CNN-BASED IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

In recent years, deep learning methods have demonstrated effectiveness across various fields [65], such as image segmentation [66] and speech recognition [67]. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly successful in image-based tasks, with many advanced deep learning models being CNN-based. Various CNNs have yielded positive results in low-level vision tasks [68] such as image de-blurring [69]–[71], image de-raining [72], image de-noising [73], low-light image enhancement [74], [75], and image dehazing [76]–[79]. However, only a few methods are specifically designed for underwater image enhancement [45].

In 2017, Perez et al. [80] proposed a CNN-based underwater image enhancement method, which trains an end-to-end transformation model between hazy images and the corresponding clear images using pairs of degraded and recovered underwater images. Meanwhile, Wang et al. [44] proposed a CNN-based underwater image enhancement framework called UIE-net (Underwater Image Enhancement-net) for color correction and haze removal. UIE-net adopts a pixel disrupting strategy to extract the inherent features of local patches of the image, which accelerates model convergence and improves accuracy.

In 2018, Anwar et al. [81] used a synthetic underwater image database produced in an indoor environment to train a convolutional neural network (UWCNN), reconstructing clear underwater latent images directly. The generality of this model was verified with real and synthetic underwater images across various underwater scenes.

To address the challenge of obtaining paired underwater images for training, researchers employed generative adversarial networks (GANs) [82] to generate realistic underwater images in an unsupervised pipeline. Li et al. [43] proposed WaterGAN, which generates synthetic real-world images from in-air images and depth maps, using these to train a two-stage deep learning network for color-cast correction of underwater images.

Similarly, Fabbri et al. [83] also adopted GANs for underwater image enhancement. They used CycleGAN to reconstruct distorted images based on undistorted images, then trained a novel Underwater-GAN to transform hazy underwater images into clear and high-resolution images.

In 2019, Li et al. [45] constructed a large-scale, real-world underwater image enhancement benchmark dataset (UIEBD), used to train DUIENet that employs a gated fusion network architecture to learn three confidence maps, enhancing underwater image quality through an innovative CNN-based approach.

以下是 Section III：IFM-Based Image Restoration 部分内容：

III. IFM-BASED IMAGE RESTORATION

Underwater image restoration usually establishes an effective degradation model by analyzing the underwater imaging mechanism and the basic physics of light propagation. It then deduces the key parameters of the constructed physical model via prior knowledge and, finally, restores the image by applying compensation processing [88]. The simplified image formation model (IFM), given by Equation (2) in Section I, is regarded as an effective and typical underwater image model for restoring underwater images. IFM-based restoration methods need to estimate two key optical parameters [89]: background light (BL) and transmission map (TM). In this section, we introduce prior-based and CNN-based image restoration approaches, explaining how these recover natural colors of underwater images by estimating BLs and TMs.

A. PRIOR-BASED IMAGE RESTORATION

Light absorption, scattering, and suspended particles are the main causes of underwater image degradation. With regard to the optical properties (e.g., selective light attenuation) or its representation (e.g., hazy effect), different prior-based methods have been developed or adapted for underwater image restoration. These include dark channel prior (DCP) [13], [90]; underwater dark channel prior (UDCP) [91], [92]; maximum intensity prior (MIP) [93]; red channel prior (RCP) [94]; blurriness prior (BP); and underwater light attenuation prior (ULAP) [95]. According to these priors, the BL and TM (or depth map) can be derived and then used in the IFM model for image restoration.

A summary of some mainstream prior-based underwater image restoration methods in chronological order is given in Table 1. The table shows the BL estimation formula (Column 3), the TM estimation formula (Column 4), and their corresponding prior knowledge (Column 5, where the left and right sides of the slash represent the prior knowledge used in BL estimation and TM estimation, respectively).

1) DCP-Based Image Restoration

DCP, proposed by He et al. [13], is widely used for image dehazing. Due to the similarities between hazy outdoor images and underwater images, DCP-based dehazing methods are widely applied to underwater image enhancement.

The dark channel prior is based on the observation that clear images contain some pixels with very low intensities (close to zero) in at least one color channel. When directly using DCP for underwater image dehazing [96], the BL can be estimated in two steps: selecting the top 0.1% brightest pixels in the dark channel, and then among these pixels, selecting the ones with the highest intensity in the input image. By minimizing both sides of the IFM model (Equation 2), the transmission map can be estimated.

2) Underwater DCP-Based Image Restoration

Since red light attenuates much faster than green and blue lights when propagating through water, the red channel in an underwater image will dominate in the dark channel. To eliminate the influence of red, Drews et al. [91] proposed the underwater dark channel prior (UDCP), which considers only the green and blue channels to produce an underwater DCP. This approach can produce a more accurate TM than DCP but may still yield unsatisfactory results due to the omission of red and GB channel imaging characteristics, especially in turbid waters.

In 2015, Galdran et al. [94] introduced an automatic red channel underwater image restoration method based on the red channel prior (RCP). This method extracts the dark channel from reversed red and blue-green channels, introducing saturation information of hazy images to adjust the TM, enhancing artificial light regions and improving overall color fidelity.

3) MIP-Based Image Restoration

The maximum intensity prior (MIP) was developed by Carlevaris et al. [93], who discovered the strong difference in attenuation between the red and green-blue channels of underwater images. MIP defines the TM as the difference between the maximum red channel intensity and the maximum of the green and blue channels. Experimental results showed that MIP could describe coarse depth maps of images, although refining is often required for detail preservation.

4) Other Prior-Based Image Restoration Methods

In addition to the priors mentioned above, there are less commonly used but effective methods for underwater image restoration. For example, Peng et al. [105] developed an improved blurriness prior (BP) to estimate underwater scene depth, and a generalized dark channel prior (GDCP) [106] based on depth-dependent color differences for estimating ambient light and TM. Li et al. [103] proposed a histogram distribution prior for contrast and brightness adjustment, while Song et al. [95] introduced the underwater light attenuation prior (ULAP), which estimates TM based on the difference between red and green-blue intensities in relation to scene depth.

B. CNN-BASED IMAGE RESTORATION

IFM-based underwater image restoration methods traditionally rely on prior knowledge and manually optimized models. However, the rapid development of deep learning has shifted research from manual optimization to automatic models that extract valuable feature vectors through instance data.

In 2017, Ding et al. [108] used a CNN to estimate BL and TM after applying a color correction algorithm. In 2018, Cao et al. [110] proposed a model that combines a coarse global CNN network with a refined network to predict scene depth maps, achieving competitive restoration results.

Barbosa et al. [111] developed a CNN-based method that utilizes a set of image quality metrics to guide the restoration learning process without ground truth data, improving visual quality and preserving edges. Hou et al. [112] introduced a CNN model combining prior knowledge and data-driven learning, achieving color correction and underwater illumination balance through residual network architectures.

IV. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS FOR UNDERWATER IMAGES: EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISONS

To study the current development of quality improvement methods for underwater images, we first introduce image quality assessment metrics and then conduct comprehensive comparisons on mainstream IFM-based underwater image restoration methods and IFM-free underwater image enhancement methods from both subjective and objective perspectives. Since BL and TM estimation determine the robustness and effectiveness of IFM-based methods, we also evaluate prior-based BL estimation models and prior-based TM estimation models, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as the effect of BL estimation on TM results.

A. THE METHODS TO BE COMPARED

The compared methods of IFM-free image enhancement include:

	•	HE [47]
	•	CLAHE [48]
	•	Integrated Colour Model (ICM) [53]
	•	Unsupervised Colour Correction Method (UCM) [33]
	•	Fusion-based Underwater Image Enhancement Method (Fusion-based, FB) [50]
	•	Underwater Image Enhancement Method based on Rayleigh Distribution (RD) [113]
	•	Relative Global Histogram Stretching (RGHS) [8].

The compared IFM-based underwater image restoration methods are:

	•	Single Image Removal (SIR) based on Dark Channel Prior (DCP) [13]
	•	Initial Underwater Image Dehazing (IUID) based on Maximum Intensity Prior (MIP) [93]
	•	DCP-based Rapid Image Restoration (RIR) [96]
	•	Transmission Estimation of Underwater Image (TEoUI) [91]
	•	New Optical Model (NOM) based underwater image restoration [100]
	•	Red Channel Prior (RCP) based underwater image restoration [94]
	•	Image Blurriness and Light Absorption (IBLA) [105]
	•	Underwater Light Attenuation Prior (ULAP) [95].

To ensure fairness in the evaluation, all test underwater images were pre-processed to a resolution of 400×600 pixels and processed by the compared methods with default parameters. All methods were implemented on a Windows 7 PC with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790U CPU @3.60GHz, 8.00GB 1600MHz DDR3 memory, and ran on Python 3.6.3.

B. IMAGE EVALUATION METRICS

Image quality can usually be affected by the optical performance of imaging equipment, instrument noise, imaging conditions, image processing, and other factors. Image quality assessment (IQA) is often divided into subjective qualitative assessment (SQA) and objective quantitative assessment (OQA).

Subjective Qualitative Assessment (SQA) relies on the human visual system (HVS) to assess the subjective impression of images. Due to the low efficiency and complexity of SQA, we present only the representative results from different image enhancement/restoration methods as a basis for subjective analysis.

Objective Quantitative Assessment (OQA) establishes a mathematical model based on the HVS to calculate a quality index. This method is efficient and suitable for large datasets, relying on non-reference (NR) methods since dehazed and natural reference images are often unavailable in complex underwater environments. To fully understand the performance of the compared underwater image quality improvement methods, we use multiple NR metrics developed for specific underwater and general images, including:

	•	Entropy: Represents the abundance of information observed from the image. Higher entropy indicates a more uniform contrast and better image clarity.
	•	Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE): A multivariate Gaussian model of high-contrast areas in images, where a lower NIQE score suggests better perceptual quality.
	•	Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE): Evaluates image naturalness, with values from 0 to 100; a lower score indicates better quality.
	•	Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation (UCIQE): A linear model that measures contrast, chroma, and saturation in CIE-Lab color space; a higher score indicates better quality.
	•	Underwater Image Quality Measure (UIQM): Combines the underwater image colorfulness measure (UICM), underwater image sharpness measure (UISM), and underwater image contrast measure (UIConM), with a higher score indicating better quality.

C. ASSESSMENT ON OPTICAL PARAMETERS OF IFM-BASED METHODS: BL & TM

1) Comparisons of BL Estimation Models

The background light (BL) estimation method for underwater images is often overlooked by researchers, yet it significantly affects the color tone and visual quality of restored images. Additionally, many transmission map (TM) estimation algorithms rely on BL estimation results, as shown in Table 1. Therefore, comparing different BL estimation models is essential for IFM-based underwater image restoration. This section evaluates the performance of different BL estimation methods through subjective and objective performance analysis.

To compare BL estimation methods based on different priors, this review selects four typical images, including shallow-sea fishes under natural light, a cliff under low-brightness scenes, wrecked ships, and a swimming batfish in the foreground area, as shown in Figure 3(a). The ground truth BLs of these test images in Figure 3(b) were manually annotated by 15 individuals based on the principle of selecting the farthest point from the camera and the light used to illuminate the background area, as detailed in our previous work [25].

Figure 3(c-m) shows the BLs estimated by different prior-based methods. Among them:

	•	Figures 3(c-e) show DCP-based estimation results.
	•	Figure 3(f) combines DCP and MIP.
	•	Figures 3(g-i) show MIP-only results.
	•	Figures 3(j) and 3(k) are UDCP-based and RCP-based results, respectively.
	•	Figures 3(l) and 3(m) are Fusion-based and ULAP-based results, respectively.

The comparison reveals that DCP-based methods often mistakenly select the brightest pixels in the image as BL, resulting in errors, as seen in Figures 3(c-e). MIP, which leverages the maximum difference between R and GB channels in background areas, effectively reduces interference from natural light and bright foregrounds, yielding BL estimates closer to the ground truth in most cases, as shown in Figures 3(g-i). However, when combining DCP with MIP, as seen in Figure 3(f), the BL results are overly bright, failing the estimation.

The RCP-based method, which considers dark regions in the R channel as BL candidates, yields correct estimations in most images except for cliff images with very dark regions where the R component is minimal (Figure 3(k)). The ULAP-based BL estimation method, considering the R and GB intensity difference as depth-correlated, also yields BLs close to the ground truth, as shown in Figure 3(m).

To quantitatively assess BL estimations across 300 underwater images, we computed the absolute differences between the estimated and ground truth BLs, setting tolerance levels for R and GB channels. Figure 4 shows that DCP-based and UDCP-based models perform poorest, while RCP-based, Fusion-based, and ULAP-based models achieve higher accuracy across all channels.

2) Comparisons of TM Estimation Models

For TM estimation, we assess the models’ accuracy using subjective assessment due to the absence of reference depth/transmission maps. Objects closer to the camera should have higher TM values (appear whiter), while farther objects should be darker. This principle is used to evaluate TM estimation accuracy based on different priors.

Four challenging underwater images were chosen to test TM models, as shown in Figure 5(a). DCP-based TMs, shown in Figures 5(b-e), perform poorly in distinguishing depth in complex scenes (like the cliff and coral images) and mistake bright spots as distant points in artificial light conditions. The MIP-based TM, seen in Figure 5(f), coarsely estimates depth but tends to produce overly bright maps with fuzzy details.

UDCP and RCP-based TMs are less affected by red attenuation, providing closer estimations in certain scenes, but RCP results are often too bright overall, limiting usability. IBLA-based methods, considering both light attenuation and blurriness, achieve detailed TM estimates but are computationally intensive. ULAP-based TMs, which rely on the intensity difference between channels, handle artificial light well, producing accurate TMs in most cases.

In summary:

	•	DCP-based TMs can work in specific underwater images but often overestimate GB channel values.
	•	MIP-based TMs provide rough depth information but require refinement.
	•	UDCP-based TMs improve upon DCP by avoiding red channel dominance.
	•	IBLA-based TMs achieve the best balance in detail accuracy, though computationally demanding.
	•	ULAP-based TMs handle artificial light effectively, though occasionally affected by high R vs. GB intensity differences.

D. OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF UNDERWATER IMAGE ENHANCEMENT AND IMAGE RESTORATION: EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we evaluate the overall performance of IFM-free and IFM-based underwater image quality improvement methods described in Section IV.A. As a benchmark, we used a dataset with four types of underwater images commonly found in the literature: a relatively clear scene and three challenging underwater images with greenish, turbid, and low-visibility scenes (see Figure 6(a)). Both subjective and objective analyses were applied to the enhanced images. For the IFM-based methods, we also demonstrate the estimated BLs and TMs to aid in the discussion.

1) Subjective Analysis

Figures 6(b-h) show the results of IFM-free image enhancement methods. Images enhanced by the Histogram Equalization (HE) method (Figure 6(b)) exhibit an overwhelming red tone, amplifying noise in the original image. Both CLAHE (Figure 6(c)) and RGHS (Figure 6(h)) use adaptive parameters to avoid global histogram stretching or blind pixel redistribution, achieving better color balance than HE. However, CLAHE struggles with certain turbid scenes, producing overly bright results. Fusion-based methods, such as those proposed by Ancuti et al. [50], offer more natural color restoration but are sensitive to scenes with significant lighting variation, as seen in Figure 6(f).

The results from IFM-based methods are shown in Figures 7(b-i). DCP-based methods, such as those used in Single Image Removal (SIR), enhance contrast but introduce color distortion, especially in low-visibility scenes (Figure 7(b)). The new optical model (NOM) effectively balances colors in greenish underwater images, as shown in Figure 7(h), although it may lose details in more complex scenes. RCP and IBLA, with their advanced TM estimation techniques, provide a good balance of color fidelity and contrast, with IBLA maintaining image clarity even in turbid and low-light conditions.

2) Objective Analysis

Table 2 summarizes the objective evaluation metrics for both IFM-free and IFM-based methods. The entropy values indicate that IFM-based methods generally provide richer information content compared to IFM-free methods, as they better account for underwater scattering and absorption effects. Among the IFM-free methods, Fusion-based methods achieve the highest entropy, indicating a balanced color restoration without excessive noise amplification.

BRISQUE scores reveal that IFM-based methods tend to produce more natural images. Specifically, IBLA achieves the best BRISQUE score, suggesting that it effectively maintains the natural characteristics of the underwater scenes while enhancing visibility. However, HE and CLAHE exhibit high BRISQUE scores, confirming their tendency to over-enhance and cause unnatural artifacts.

In terms of UIQM and UCIQE, which focus on underwater-specific aspects like color and contrast, IBLA and ULAP score highest, demonstrating their efficacy in addressing underwater lighting challenges. DCP-based methods perform poorly in these metrics, largely due to their tendency to overestimate TMs, which affects overall color balance.

3) Discussion

From the analysis, it is clear that IFM-free methods are generally faster and easier to implement but often lack robustness across different underwater scenes. For instance, HE and CLAHE tend to amplify artifacts and produce overly bright results in turbid conditions, while Fusion-based methods offer a more balanced enhancement but struggle with lighting inconsistencies.

IFM-based methods, although computationally intensive, offer more consistent results across diverse underwater environments. RCP and IBLA, for instance, achieve high image quality by accurately estimating both BL and TM, which enhances color fidelity and contrast. However, IBLA’s high computational requirements make it less suitable for real-time applications.

Overall, future research in underwater image quality improvement should focus on developing more efficient algorithms that combine the robustness of IFM-based methods with the simplicity of IFM-free approaches, potentially through hybrid models or deep learning techniques. Moreover, improved evaluation metrics that better capture the unique challenges of underwater environments could provide clearer benchmarks for comparing different methods.

V. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

While significant advancements have been made in underwater image enhancement and restoration, several challenges and research opportunities remain. This section discusses the primary limitations of current approaches and suggests potential directions for future research in underwater imaging.

A. Challenges and Limitations

	1.	Limited Generalization Across Environments: Many methods perform well under certain underwater conditions but may not generalize to diverse scenarios with varying lighting, turbidity, or depth. For instance, methods that rely heavily on specific priors, such as DCP and UDCP, may fail in highly turbid or low-light environments, where prior-based assumptions do not hold.
	2.	Computational Complexity: IFM-based methods, especially those using deep learning or complex transmission map estimation (e.g., IBLA), often require substantial computational resources. This limits their usability in real-time applications or on low-power devices like underwater robots or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).
	3.	Dependency on Paired Data: CNN-based methods generally require paired data for supervised training. However, paired datasets with both degraded and clear underwater images are rare and difficult to capture. Synthetic data can be used, but it often fails to capture the true complexity of natural underwater scenes, leading to models that may not perform well in real-world conditions.
	4.	Evaluation Metrics: Current evaluation metrics may not fully capture underwater-specific quality attributes. While metrics such as entropy, NIQE, and BRISQUE provide some insights, they do not directly assess aspects like depth clarity, color fidelity, and visibility under underwater lighting conditions. Developing more comprehensive underwater-specific metrics could help better evaluate and compare methods.

B. Future Directions

	1.	Hybrid Approaches: Combining the strengths of IFM-based and IFM-free methods could lead to more robust underwater image enhancement. For example, hybrid models that utilize prior-based estimations for initial corrections and CNNs for further refinements could achieve high quality without extreme computational costs.
	2.	Real-Time and Efficient Models: There is a growing demand for real-time enhancement models suitable for integration with underwater robotic systems. Techniques such as model compression, knowledge distillation, and lightweight CNN architectures could be explored to reduce computation and make models deployable on limited-power devices.
	3.	Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning: To address the scarcity of paired data, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches may be promising. GAN-based frameworks that generate realistic underwater images without paired training data, as demonstrated by WaterGAN and similar models, show potential. Further refinement and adaptation of these methods could improve their robustness in real-world underwater scenes.
	4.	Adaptive Models for Varying Environments: Developing models that can dynamically adapt to different underwater conditions could significantly enhance robustness. These models could leverage contextual cues, such as depth, turbidity, or lighting information, to adjust parameters or apply specific priors, optimizing enhancement for specific environments.
	5.	Improved Evaluation Frameworks: Establishing standardized evaluation frameworks for underwater image quality, considering factors like visibility, color fidelity, and depth accuracy, would provide clearer benchmarks. This could include metrics tailored to underwater imaging, such as clarity at different depths, color restoration under varying lighting, and improved visibility for objects at different distances.

C. Conclusion

This paper presents a comprehensive review and experimental evaluation of current underwater image enhancement and restoration methods. By categorizing methods into IFM-free and IFM-based approaches and evaluating them across multiple metrics, we provide insights into each method’s strengths, limitations, and ideal application scenarios. Despite the progress made, achieving high-quality, real-time underwater image enhancement across varied environments remains a challenging task. Future research focusing on hybrid models, adaptive methods, and improved evaluation criteria holds promise for overcoming these challenges and advancing underwater imaging technology.
